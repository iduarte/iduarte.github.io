    "text": "The Full Story\nAs Portugal counts down to its presidential election in January 2026, I’ve found myself unable to escape the chorus of political commentators dissecting poll after poll. This election is unprecedented: 11 candidates running for the presidency, though the ballot will somehow list 14 names (a peculiarity that deserves its own post entirely in another type of blog). But what’s been nagging at me isn’t the crowded field. It’s something the analysts keep repeating like a mantra: “The numbers don’t lie.” They acknowledge, almost dismissively, that different polls yield different results: due to different timing, different sample sizes, slightly different methodologies, but they always circle back to that reassuring phrase: “The numbers don’t lie”. And every time I hear it, something in my brain twitches. Because while it’s true that numbers don’t lie, they also don’t speak for themselves. They can tell contradictory truths simultaneously. They can show one thing in the whole and the opposite in the parts. This is what kept popping into my mind as I watched yet another commentator gesture at bar charts: Simpson’s Paradox.\nThis is a statistical phenomenon that, once you understand it, will forever change how you look at data. In fact, the Simpson’s Paradox, reveals something profound about the relationship between statistics, causation, and the stories we tell ourselves about evidence.\n\nThe Paradox in Action\nImagine a clinical trial for a new drug. You analyze the results and find:\n\nAmong men: the drug works better than placebo (61% vs 57% recovery)\nAmong women: the drug works better than placebo (44% vs 40% recovery)\n\nSo the drug helps everyone, right? Time to approve it?\nHere’s the twist: when you pool all the data together, the drug shows no effect whatsoever: exactly 50% recovery in both the treatment and control groups.\nThis isn’t a mathematical error. It’s Simpson’s Paradox: an association that holds in every subgroup can vanish - or even reverse - when you combine the data.\n\n\nHow Is This Possible?\nThe key lies in how people ended up in each group. In our example, women were more likely to receive the treatment (27 of 40 treated patients were women), while men dominated the control group. Since men recover at higher rates regardless of treatment, this imbalance masks the drug’s genuine effect.\nThe aggregate statistics aren’t lying, exactly. They’re just answering a different question than the one we think we’re asking.\n\n\nWhy This Matters Beyond Statistics\nWhat fascinates me about Simpson’s Paradox isn’t the mathematics (that part is actually straightforward once you see it). What’s fascinating is what it reveals about human reasoning.\nJudea Pearl (see my blog post The book of why), the computer scientist who revolutionized causal inference, argues that the paradox feels paradoxical because we instinctively conflate two very different things:\n\nObservational claims: “People who take this drug are more likely to recover.”\nCausal claims: “Taking this drug will make you more likely to recover.”\n\nThese sound similar but aren’t the same. The first describes a correlation in existing data. The second describes what would happen if we intervened - if we actually gave the drug to someone.\nPearl’s insight is that if we interpret the conditional probabilities causally (as describing what happens when we intervene), then Simpson-style reversals become impossible, provided the partitioning variable (like gender) isn’t itself affected by the treatment. Our intuition isn’t wrong - it’s just operating on causal assumptions that the raw statistics don’t warrant.\n\n\nThe Real-World Stakes\nThis isn’t just academic hairsplitting. Simpson’s Paradox has appeared in:\n\nCOVID-19 mortality data: Early in the pandemic, Italy’s overall case fatality rate exceeded China’s, yet within every age group, China’s rate was higher. The difference? Italy had an older population.\nUniversity admissions: Berkeley’s famous 1973 study showed men admitted at higher rates overall, yet no individual department favored men. Women simply applied disproportionately to more competitive departments.\nEducational testing: SAT scores rose in US between 1992 and 2002, yet scores fell within every grade-point-average category. Grade inflation meant each category was losing its best students to the tier above.\n\nIn each case, the aggregate statistic tells a true but misleading story. The subgroup statistics tell a different true story. Neither is wrong - they are just answering different questions.\n\n\nThe Deeper Lesson\nI think Simpson’s Paradox endures as a topic of fascination because it sits at the intersection of mathematics, psychology, and philosophy. It forces us to confront uncomfortable questions:\nWhat are we actually asking when we ask if something “works”?\nThe drug example shows that “works” is ambiguous. Works for whom? Under what conditions? Compared to what counterfactual?\nCan we ever trust aggregate statistics?\nYes, but only if we understand the causal structure generating them. A well-designed randomized trial eliminates the paradox by ensuring treatment assignment is independent of confounding factors. The mathematics doesn’t change; we just control which mathematics applies.\nWhy does our intuition fail here?\nPerhaps because in everyday reasoning, we rarely encounter situations where a variable (like gender) is simultaneously associated with both the cause (treatment assignment) and the effect (recovery). Or perhaps because we’ve evolved to think causally, and the statistical framing tricks us into applying causal intuitions where they don’t belong.\n\n\nA Humbling Thought\nSimpson’s Paradox reminds us that data doesn’t interpret itself. Behind every dataset lies a causal structure, i.e. a web of relationships determining who ends up where and why. Statistics can describe patterns in the data, but they can’t tell us which patterns reflect genuine causal relationships and which are artifacts of how the data were generated.\nThis is why I find the paradox oddly comforting. It’s a built-in reminder that analysis requires humility. The numbers are never the whole story. The whole story requires understanding the process that produced the numbers, and that understanding doesn’t come from the data alone.",

Simpson’s Paradox reveals that these numbers can be simultaneously true and deeply misleading - not through anyone’s dishonesty, but through the hidden structure of how data gets generated. Understanding this paradox is intellectual self-defense. It’s the difference between being manipulated by a cherry-picked aggregate statistic and asking the right question: “But what happens when you break it down by…?” Whether you’re evaluating a medical treatment, interpreting crime statistics, assessing school performance, or deciding whether some intervention actually caused an outcome, the paradox teaches a crucial lesson that extends far beyond mathematics: the story you see depends entirely on how you slice the data, and the “right” way to slice it depends on causal knowledge that the statistics themselves cannot provide. In a world where data is increasingly weaponized to persuade, knowing that associations can reverse - that a drug can help everyone yet help no one, that discrimination can exist in the whole yet vanish in the parts - transforms you from a passive consumer of statistics into someone who knows which questions to ask.\nThe next time you see a headline claiming that some treatment “doesn’t work” or that some factor “has no effect,” ask yourself: in which subgroups? Under what conditions? And what’s the causal story that generated these statistics in the first place?",

    "text": "The BioLogical Footnote\n\nPerhaps what makes Simpson’s Paradox so persistently unsettling is that it mirrors something we already know about life but prefer to ignore: context isn’t just important, it is constitutive. We want to believe that facts are facts, that a treatment either works or it doesn’t, that a policy either succeeds or fails. But the paradox whispers something more uncomfortable: the same intervention, the same choice, the same action can be simultaneously beneficial and harmful depending on where you stand. This isn’t relativism; the math is precise. It’s something stranger: a reminder that “what happened” is never separable from “to whom” and “under what circumstances.” The paradox doesn’t just challenge how we analyze data. It challenges the very notion that there’s a view from nowhere, a god’s-eye perspective from which the true effect simply is. Maybe the deepest lesson isn’t statistical at all: it’s that the question “does it work?” is incomplete until we finish the sentence.",

    "section": "The Full Story",
    "text": "The Full Story\n\nWhat Is a Gene? A Concept That Refuses to Stand Still\nAt first glance, a gene seems like one of biology’s most basic building blocks: a piece of DNA that makes a trait. Yet, for more than a century, scientists and philosophers have repeatedly questioned whether the gene is a clear, stable, or even useful concept. The surprise is not that the gene has been challenged, but that it has endured.\nThe reason lies in how scientific concepts actually work. They are not fixed definitions carved in stone. Instead, they evolve alongside scientific practices, technologies, and questions. The gene is a prime example of a “concept in flux”: its meaning has shifted many times, adapted to new discoveries, and diversified across fields, while remaining central to biology.\n\n\nFrom Inherited Traits to Abstract Factors\nThe story begins with Gregor Mendel in the 19th century. Mendel did not set out to discover “genes” or laws of heredity. He was studying how traits behave in plant hybrids. His key innovation was methodological: focusing on individual traits, counting large numbers of offspring, and using a symbolic notation to track inheritance patterns.\nFrom this, regularities emerged - dominance, segregation, and independent assortment. Mendel spoke of “elements” or “factors” in reproductive cells, but he did not claim they were universal units of heredity, nor did he know what they were made of. The gene, at this stage, was not a thing but an inferred difference-maker.\nAround 1900, Mendel’s work was rediscovered and transformed into Mendelism. These regularities were now treated as general laws of heredity, and the idea took hold that inheritance depended on discrete units passed through gametes. Still, these units were theoretical placeholders, not physical objects.\n\n\nNaming the Gene, Without Explaining It\nIn 1909, Wilhelm Johannsen introduced the word “gene” precisely to avoid premature assumptions. A gene, he said, was simply “something” in the gametes that makes a difference to traits. He also introduced the crucial distinction between genotype (what is inherited) and phenotype (what develops through interaction with the environment).\nThis move was paradoxical but powerful. By stripping the gene of speculative meaning, Johannsen made it a workable scientific object. Genes could now be inferred from observable differences without committing to how they functioned or what they were made of.\n\n\nGenes on Chromosomes, Not Blueprints\nEarly 20th-century genetics, especially through the work of Thomas Hunt Morgan and his group, linked genes to chromosomes. By studying fruit flies, they showed that genes are arranged linearly, can recombine, and can be mapped relative to one another.\nThis established the “classical gene” as a material unit located on chromosomes. However, even then, genes were not seen as simple instructions for traits. One gene could affect many traits, and many genes could affect one trait. Genetic causation was about differences, not direct construction. Development remained a complex, interactive process.\n\n\nFrom Genes to Molecules\nThe mid-20th century brought a major shift: the identification of DNA as the genetic material and the discovery of its double-helix structure. This solved a long-standing puzzle - how genes could copy themselves - and reframed genes as sequences of DNA.\nWith the cracking of the genetic code, genes came to be understood as templates for proteins. This gave rise to the “classical molecular gene”: a stretch of DNA that is transcribed into RNA and translated into a protein. For a time, biology embraced a clean formula: one gene, one protein.\nBut this clarity did not last.\n\n\nThe Gene Becomes Complicated Again\nMolecular biology soon revealed that genes are not neat, continuous units. In eukaryotes, genes are split into exons and introns; RNA can be spliced in multiple ways; editing, overlapping transcripts, regulatory regions, and non-coding RNAs are pervasive. One DNA region can produce many different products, and one product can draw on multiple genomic regions.\nAt the same time, gene regulation, development, and evolution revealed that DNA works within dense networks of interactions. Genes respond to cellular contexts; they do not act alone or issue fixed instructions.\n\n\nGenomics and the Post-Genomic Gene\nThe sequencing of whole genomes intensified these challenges. Humans turned out to have far fewer protein-coding genes than expected, and much of the genome is transcribed without coding for proteins. Projects like ENCODE showed that functional genomic elements overlap extensively and defy simple boundaries.\nThis led to the idea of a “post-genomic gene”: not a single stretch of DNA, but a set of genomic sequences that together give rise to a coherent set of functional products. In this view, genes are defined as much by what they do as by where they are.\n\n\nMany Gene Concepts, One Word\nToday, biology uses multiple gene concepts side by side:\n\nInstrumental genes, used to predict inheritance patterns.\nMolecular genes, defined by DNA sequences and products.\nDevelopmental genes, understood as resources in complex processes.\nPost-genomic genes, seen as distributed and context-dependent.\n\nNone of these has replaced the others. Instead, the gene remains useful precisely because it is flexible. Its vagueness allows it to connect disciplines, adapt to new technologies, and support different explanatory goals.\n\n\nWhy the Gene Persists\nThe gene has survived not because it is simple, but because it is productive. It evolves with biology itself, absorbing new meanings without collapsing. Rather than being a fixed entity, the gene is a bridge between heredity, development, evolution, and molecular mechanisms.",

    "text": "The Full Story\n\nWhat Is Life?\nBiology textbooks often present life as a neat checklist: metabolism, reproduction, evolution, organisation. Yet, the moment scientists look closely, that clarity dissolves. Fire uses energy. Crystals organise themselves. Viruses evolve but do not metabolise. Parasites cannot survive alone. The boundary between life and non-life is blurry, and it always has been. Despite centuries of debate, no definition cleanly captures everything we intuitively call “alive” without also including things that clearly are not.\nThis difficulty is not academic nit-picking. Modern science increasingly needs a working notion of life. Astrobiologists must decide what counts as life when searching other planets. Synthetic biologists ask whether a lab-built system is genuinely alive or merely lifelike. Origins-of-life researchers face the puzzle of how chemistry crossed an invisible threshold into biology. Each field pulls the concept of life in a different direction, revealing that “life” may not be a single thing at all.\n\n\nFrom Souls to Systems\nHistorically, life has been understood in radically different ways. Plato divided it into vegetal, animal, and rational life. Aristotle saw it as self-directed organisation resisting disruption. Descartes treated animals as sophisticated machines while reserving inner life for humans. Vitalists later argued that life required a special force beyond chemistry, a view eventually weakened (but never fully erased) by advances in biochemistry.\nModern definitions reflect this diversity. Some focus on metabolism and energy flow, others on cells, information, evolution, or interaction with the environment. Thousands of definitions exist, none universally accepted. Attempts to impose a single, rigid definition increasingly give way to skepticism: perhaps defining life is not only difficult, but unnecessary—or even misleading. Some philosophers argue that insisting on one definition risks blinding us to unfamiliar forms of life.\n\n\nLife Beyond Organisms\nThe problem becomes sharper at the edges. Are viruses alive? What about prions, protocells, or digital organisms? At larger scales, could ant colonies (or even Earth itself) count as living systems? The famous Gaia hypothesis pushed this idea to its limit, suggesting that life might operate at planetary scale. Whether convincing or not, such ideas show how flexible the concept becomes when stretched beyond familiar organisms.\nEthics and politics further complicate matters. Questions about when life begins or ends underpin debates on abortion, euthanasia, and emerging technologies like transhumanism. Yet biology alone cannot resolve these issues, because “life” is often conflated with sentience, personhood, or moral value—concepts that do not neatly align.\n\n\nWhere Does This Leave Us?\nAfter centuries of effort, there is no consensus—and perhaps there never will be. Future discoveries may force a reorganisation of our concepts, just as atomic theory reshaped chemistry. Alternatively, science may settle on practical, context-specific meanings of life, much as medicine did with the definition of death. Or we may accept that “life” is a family of related ideas: metabolic life, evolutionary life, informational life - each useful in its own domain.\nFor now, life remains one of science’s most productive uncertainties: a concept everyone uses, no one fully agrees on, and one that continues to shape how we understand ourselves, our planet, and the possibility that we are not alone.",

    "section": "The Full Story",
    "text": "The Full Story\n\nThe Hook\nWhat if most of what we call “data-driven insight” is fundamentally unable to answer the questions we actually care about? In The Book of Why, Judea Pearl makes a provocative claim: modern data analysis excels at finding patterns, yet often fails at explaining why things happen. And without “why”, prediction alone is not the same as understanding.\n\n\nThe Big Idea\nAt the heart of the book is a simple but radical message: correlation is not causation, and pretending otherwise limits science, policy, and artificial intelligence. Judea Pearl argues that we need a formal language of causation - one that allows us to reason about interventions, explanations, and counterfactuals, not just associations in data.\nTo do this, he introduces a rigorous framework based on causal models, diagrams, and logical rules that make assumptions explicit rather than hidden.\n\n\nHow It Works?\nA key tool in the book is the use of causal diagrams (directed acyclic graphs) - simple arrows that encode how variables influence one another. These diagrams clarify which variables should be controlled for, and which should not, something traditional statistical approaches often get wrong.\nJudea Pearl uses Simpson’s paradox as a recurring example: situations where a trend appears in every subgroup but reverses when the data are combined. The paradox is not a statistical oddity; it is a signal that causal structure has been ignored. Once the causal relationships are made explicit, the paradox dissolves.\nThe book also explains why adjusting for the wrong variable, such as a collider, can introduce bias rather than remove it. These ideas are counterintuitive when learned through equations alone, but become immediately clear when visualised causally.\n\n\nThe Plot Twist\nOne of the most striking ideas in The Book of Why is the Ladder of Causation, a three-level hierarchy of reasoning:\n\nSeeing - observing correlations (“What is?”)\nDoing - intervening (“What happens if we do X?”)\nImagining - counterfactuals (“What would have happened if…?”)\n\nJudea Pearl argues that much of modern machine learning and AI is stuck on the first rung. These systems can predict extremely well, yet fail when asked simple causal questions. A model that cannot reason about interventions or counterfactuals, he argues, is fundamentally limited, no matter how impressive its accuracy.\n\n\nWhy Should Scientists Care?\nFor scientists, the book is a direct challenge to decades of methodological caution that discouraged causal language. Judea Pearl argues that avoiding words like “cause” and “effect” did not make science safer - it made it less honest about its assumptions.\nCausal models do not eliminate uncertainty: they expose it. By making assumptions explicit and testable, they allow disagreements to be resolved logically rather than rhetorically. From epidemiology to economics, the book shows how causal reasoning can settle questions that statistics alone could not.\n\n\nWhy Should Non-Scientists Care?\nBecause real-world decisions are causal by nature. When we ask whether a treatment works, a policy helps, or an action caused harm, we are not asking about correlations, we are asking what would happen if we acted differently.\nThe Book of Why equips readers with a way to think clearly about such questions. It explains why “the data says so” is often not enough, and why understanding cause and effect is essential for medicine, public policy, law, and everyday reasoning.",

The result is a literature that looks more certain than it really is. Open science emerged as a response, promoting transparency, pre-registration, data and code sharing, and new publishing models.

What it saw was uncomfortable: many published results could not be reproduced when other researchers tried to repeat them. This situation became widely known as the “reproducibility crisis” - or, more optimistically, what some now call a “credibility revolution.”\nBut what does reproducibility actually mean? Why does it matter beyond academic debates? And what is science doing about it?\nLet’s explore this.\n\n\nReproducibility in Simple Terms\nAt its core, reproducibility asks a very basic question:\n\nIf someone else follows the same steps, do they get the same result?\n\nIn practice, this can mean different things depending on the field:\n\nComputational reproducibility: Can others rerun the same data and code and obtain the same numbers?\nExperimental replication: Can others redo the experiment - collect new data - and still observe the same effect?\nConceptual replication:Does the underlying idea or hypothesis still hold when tested under different conditions, with different methods, or in different contexts?\n\nA study can be perfectly reproducible in terms of code and methods, yet still fail to reproduce its original findings. This distinction turns out to be crucial.\n\n\nWhy the “Crisis” Emerged\nLarge, coordinated efforts to replicate published studies revealed an uncomfortable pattern:\n\nMany results, especially in psychology, medicine, and biology, failed to replicate.\nReplication studies themselves were rarely published.\nJournals strongly favoured novel, positive, statistically significant results.\nMethods and data were often poorly reported or unavailable.\n\nOne famous psychology project found that only around 40% of results replicated successfully. In some biomedical research, reproducibility rates were even lower - sometimes close to 10–20%.\nThis is not because most scientists are dishonest. Instead, it reflects how science has been incentivised.\n\n\nThe Hidden Machinery Behind Irreproducible Science\nSeveral systemic issues fuel irreproducibility:\n\n1. Publication Bias\nStudies that “work” get published. Studies that don’t often disappear into a drawer. This distorts the scientific record.\n\n\n2. Low Statistical Power\nMany studies are too small to reliably detect real effects - yet still report strong conclusions.\n\n\n3. Questionable Research Practices\nUnder pressure to publish, researchers may:\n\nTry multiple analyses and report only the successful ones (“p-hacking”)\nDrop inconvenient data points\nPresent unexpected findings as if they were predicted all along (“HARKing”)\n\nSurveys suggest that a large fraction of researchers admit to using such practices at least once.\n\n\n4. Over-reliance on p-values\nThe obsession with crossing an arbitrary threshold (usually p &lt; 0.05) encourages binary thinking: significant or not, publishable or not, even when the evidence is weak.\n\n\n\nIs Replication Always the Final Judge?\nPhilosophically, replication is more subtle than it first appears.\nWhen a replication fails, two interpretations are possible:\n\nThe original result was wrong.\nThe replication was not done “properly”.\n\nThis creates what philosophers call the experimenters’ regress: to judge whether a replication is valid, you already need agreement about what counts as a correct experiment.\nDespite this, replication still matters - not because any single attempt is decisive, but because patterns across many attempts gradually shift our confidence. Even repeated failures, none of them conclusive on their own, can collectively erode belief in a claim.\n\n\nA Turning Point: The Rise of Meta-Science\nOut of the crisis emerged a new field: meta-science, the scientific study of science itself.\nMeta-scientists:\n\nRun large-scale replication projects\nMeasure publication bias\nStudy how incentives shape behaviour\nTest interventions to improve transparency\n\nTheir findings made one thing clear: science’s problems are structural, not moral.\n\n\nThe Open Science Response\nIn response, the open science movement has pushed for practical reforms:\n\nPre-registration: stating hypotheses and analysis plans before seeing the data\nData and code sharing\nRegistered Reports, where studies are accepted before results are known\nClearer reporting standards\nNew incentives, such as open science badges\n\nThese changes aim to realign scientific practice with its core goal: getting closer to the truth, not just producing eye-catching results.\n\n\nValues Matter More Than We Admit\nAt heart, the reproducibility debate is about values.\nScience officially values:\n\nAccuracy\nTransparency\nSkepticism\nShared knowledge\n\nBut in practice, it often rewards:\n\nNovelty\nSpeed\nPrestige\nPositive results\n\nOpen science is not about mistrust. As its advocates put it:\n\nOpenness is not needed because scientists are untrustworthy - it is needed because scientists are human.\n\nBy changing incentives, science can better support the values it already claims to uphold.\n\n\nWhy Should Non-Scientists Care?\nReproducibility is not an abstract academic concern.\nIt affects:\n\nWhich medical treatments are developed\nWhich policies are justified by evidence\nWhich findings enter textbooks and public discourse\n\nWhen results cannot be trusted, society pays the price: financially, medically, and intellectually.\nThe reproducibility debate is therefore not a sign of science failing. It is a sign of science taking responsibility for its own foundations.\nAnd that is something worth caring about.",

    "text": "The BioLogical Footnote\n\nPerhaps the most uncomfortable implication of the reproducibility debate is that it forces us to admit that many scientific results were never meant to be durable. They were optimised for being publishable, not for being true. Seen this way, the debate raises a quiet but radical question: are scientific results events, or are they commitments? An event happens once and is remembered; a commitment must withstand being revisited, questioned, and tested by others. Reproducibility is therefore not just a technical standard or a methodological fix. It is a redefinition of what we expect scientific knowledge to be: less spectacular, slower to accumulate, but build to last.",

    "section": "The Full Story",
    "text": "The Full Story\n\nInformation as Biology’s Organizing Principle\nThe concept of information represents one of the most profound intellectual shifts in modern biology - not merely a metaphor, but a fundamental organizing principle that reveals why living systems behave so differently from simple physical systems.\n\n\nWhy Every Biologist Should Care\nConsider this paradox: thermodynamics tells us that entropy always increases, yet living organisms create and maintain extraordinary order. They grow, reproduce, and evolve increasingly complex structures. This apparent contradiction dissolves when we recognize that biological systems are fundamentally information-processing entities that use energy to create, maintain, and transmit information against the gradient of entropy.\nWithout understanding information, you’re missing the forest for the trees. You might catalog every molecular interaction in a cell, yet fail to grasp why those particular interactions exist and persist across billions of years of evolution.\n\n\nWhat Is Biological Information?\nBiological information is specification with functional consequences. This definition has three critical components:\nSpecification: The DNA sequence ATGCCG specifies something different from ATGCCT. The difference matters because it changes which amino acid gets incorporated into a protein.\nFunction: Not all specification is information. Random sequences specify states, but biological information specifically refers to sequences that do work - they fold proteins, regulate genes, or guide development. Information is that which reduces uncertainty about functionally relevant outcomes.\nContext-dependence: Here’s where it gets philosophically rich: information only exists in relation to an interpretive system. The genetic code is meaningless without ribosomes, tRNAs, and the entire translation machinery. This makes biological information fundamentally different from Shannon information (which treats all sequences as equivalent) and closer to semantic information.\n\n\nThe Philosophical Foundation\nJohn Maynard Smith and Eors Szathmáry’s concept of major evolutionary transitions provides the clearest argument for information’s centrality. Every major leap in biological complexity - from replicating molecules to chromosomes, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, from single cells to multicellular organisms - involved new ways of storing, transmitting, or processing information.\nThis isn’t coincidental. It reflects a deep principle: evolution is an information-generating process. Natural selection acts as an algorithm that discovers functional sequences from the incomprehensibly vast space of possible sequences. The human genome contains roughly 3 billion base pairs, representing one arrangement from 4(3×109) possibilities - a number so large it makes the number of atoms in the universe look quaint.\n\n\nThe Teleosemantics Argument\nHere’s where philosophy of science becomes indispensable. How can we talk about biological information carrying “meaning” without invoking vitalism or teleology?\nThe answer lies in teleosemantics (primarily developed by Ruth Millikan and Karen Neander): biological information has meaning because of its evolutionary history. A gene “means” build a particular protein because organisms with that sequence-to-function relationship survived and reproduced more successfully than those without it. The meaning is grounded in causal history, not mysterious purpose.\nThis resolves the apparent circularity: genes specify proteins, but only because evolution selected genes that specify useful proteins. Information and function co-evolve.\n\n\nInformation Flow as Causation\nErnst Mayr distinguished between proximate and ultimate causation in biology. Information provides the bridge:\n\nProximate: How does development work? Through precisely orchestrated information flows - transcription factors binding enhancers, signaling cascades, epigenetic marks guiding cell fate.\nUltimate: Why do these particular information flows exist? Because they encoded solutions to evolutionary problems.\n\nEvery developmental process, every physiological response, every behavior involves information transfer that was selected for its functional consequences. When you study any biological phenomenon without considering its information architecture, you’re like someone trying to understand software by examining only the physics of transistors.\n\n\nThe Counterargument Worth Considering\nSome philosophers (notably C. Kenneth Waters) argue that “genetic information” is a misleading metaphor that obscures the distributed, context-dependent nature of causation in development. They’re right that we shouldn’t be genocentric - information exists at multiple levels (epigenetic, cellular, ecological).\nBut this critique actually strengthens the case for informational thinking: it forces us to recognize that biology involves information processing at every scale, from molecular to ecological. The question isn’t whether information is relevant, but rather which information flows matter for explaining a given phenomenon.\n\n\nPractical Implications\nUnderstanding information transforms how you think about:\n\nDisease: Many pathologies are information-processing failures (misfolded proteins, regulatory mutations, disrupted signaling)\nEvolution: Not just selection on phenotypes, but on the information that generates phenotypes\nSynthetic biology: Engineering organisms means engineering information-processing systems\nDrug development: Intervening in specific information flows rather than bluntly blocking pathways\n\nIn your clinical research work, every endpoint you measure ultimately traces back to information flows that went right or wrong. Survival analysis isn’t just about time-to-event - it’s about how long information-processing systems (patients’ bodies) can maintain function against entropic decay and pathological perturbation.\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\nThinking informationally doesn’t replace molecular, cellular, or organismal biology - it integrates them. It reveals the logic underlying the mechanisms. And that logical structure is what makes biology more than physics, what makes it a science of functional organization maintained across time through information transmission.",

    "text": "The Full Story\n“Cancer” is a single word that hides an uncomfortable truth: it refers to hundreds of different diseases.\nWe use the same label for a childhood leukemia, a melanoma caused by sun exposure, and a lung tumour driven by decades of smoking. This linguistic convenience is useful in everyday conversation, but scientifically it can be misleading. Much of the frustration around cancer - including the recurring question “Why haven’t we cured it yet?” - comes from taking that word too literally.\nTo understand where we stand today, it helps to unpack what we really mean when we talk about cancer.\n\nCancer: Not one disease, but many\nCancer is not a single entity in the way tuberculosis or measles are. It is a broad category defined less by cause than by outcome: cells that grow when they should not, refuse to stop, and sometimes spread.\nA breast cancer and a pancreatic cancer arise in different tissues, accumulate different mutations, interact with different microenvironments, and respond to different treatments. Even two tumours from the same organ can behave like entirely different diseases once you look at their molecular profiles.\nThis is not a minor detail. It is the central reason why there is no single “cure for cancer”. Expecting one universal solution is like expecting the same drug to cure asthma, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease - simply because they all affect humans.\nAnd yet, calling cancer only a collection of unrelated diseases is also unsatisfying.\n\n\nWhat all cancers have in common\nDespite their diversity, cancers do share something fundamental: they are diseases of broken cellular control.\nEvery cancer begins when normal cells accumulate genetic and epigenetic changes that allow them to ignore the rules governing growth, death, and cooperation within tissues. In that sense, cancer is not foreign - it is our own biology pushed into a pathological regime.\nThis tension - deep diversity built on shared principles - motivated one of the most influential ideas in modern cancer biology: the hallmarks of cancer.\n\n\nThe hallmarks: unity beneath diversity\nIn 2000, Douglas Hanahan and Robert Weinberg proposed that all cancers, regardless of tissue or origin, acquire a common set of capabilities during their evolution. These include:\n\nSustaining their own growth signals\nIgnoring growth-inhibitory cues\nResisting cell death\nDividing indefinitely\nRecruiting blood vessels\nInvading and spreading to other tissues\n\nLater additions included immune evasion, altered metabolism, genomic instability, and tumour-promoting inflammation.\nThe power of the hallmarks framework is not that it erases differences between cancers, but that it gives us a shared language. It explains how wildly different tumours can still converge on the same functional solutions: grow faster, survive longer, spread further.\nFrom a research perspective, this matters enormously. It means we can design therapies that target capabilities rather than individual mutations - a partial unification in an otherwise fragmented landscape.\n\n\nSo why haven’t we cured cancer?\nThere is no single reason - but several recurring ones.\nFirst, cancer is not static. Tumours evolve. They are genetically heterogeneous, and treatment itself applies selective pressure. Kill the sensitive cells, and resistant ones may survive and expand. This is evolution in real time, inside the body.\nSecond, the most dangerous feature of cancer is metastasis. Once cancer spreads, eliminating every last malignant cell becomes extraordinarily difficult. A handful of surviving cells can be enough for relapse.\nThird, cancer cells are not invaders - they are altered versions of ourselves. This makes them hard to target without damaging healthy tissue. There is a narrow margin between effective treatment and unacceptable toxicity.\nFinally, cancers actively hide. They suppress immune responses, remodel their environment, and co-opt normal cells to support their survival. They are not passive targets.\nSeen this way, the absence of a universal cure is not a failure of effort or intelligence. It is a reflection of the problem’s depth.\n\n\nWhere hope genuinely lies\nDespite this complexity, progress has been real - and in some cases, transformative, and what gives reason for hope today is not a single breakthrough, but a convergence of advances that are finally changing the rules of the game.\nOne of the most profound shifts has come from immunotherapy. Rather than attacking cancer directly, checkpoint inhibitors remove the molecular brakes that tumours use to suppress immune responses. In some patients, this leads to long-lasting remissions, even in advanced disease. CAR T-cell therapies go a step further by genetically reprogramming a patient’s own immune cells to recognise cancer. In certain blood cancers, this has produced outcomes that are effectively cures. While these approaches do not yet work for everyone, they have demonstrated something crucial: the immune system can eliminate cancer if it is allowed to function properly.\nAt the same time, precision medicine has transformed how we think about treatment. As tumour sequencing became routine, it became clear that many cancers are driven by specific molecular alterations. Targeted therapies designed against these drivers have turned some previously fatal cancers into manageable (and sometimes curable) diseases. Resistance remains a challenge, but each success reinforces a central lesson: deep biological understanding creates real therapeutic leverage.\nAnother important frontier is cell-based and gene-edited therapies. Beyond CAR T-cells, researchers are engineering immune cells to be more persistent, more precise, and less easily suppressed by tumours. Early clinical trials using CRISPR-edited immune cells show that it is possible to safely reprogram biology itself, shifting cancer treatment from passive drug delivery to active biological intervention.\nProgress is also coming from prevention and early detection. Vaccines against cancer-causing viruses have already reduced cancer incidence, and emerging technologies such as liquid biopsies aim to detect tumours before they become clinically apparent. In cancer, timing often determines curability.\nFinally, there is growing recognition that cancer must be treated as an evolving system. Combination therapies are increasingly designed to block multiple escape routes at once, reducing the chance of resistance. This approach reflects a more mature view of cancer biology: not as a single target, but as a dynamic process that must be outpaced rather than simply attacked.\nThere will be no single cure for cancer. But many cancers are already becoming curable, others controllable, and fewer inevitably fatal. Hope today is not speculative. It is incremental, evidence-based, and cumulative, and for the first time, it is moving faster than the disease itself.\n\n\nRethinking what “curing cancer” means\nPerhaps the most important shift is conceptual.\nThe goal is no longer a mythical single cure for “cancer”. Instead, it is a future where:\n\nMany cancers are cured outright\nOthers are controlled long-term\nDiagnosis happens earlier\nTreatment is precise rather than blunt\n\nCancer will not disappear as a biological possibility - it is too deeply tied to multicellular life and evolution. But its capacity to devastate lives can, and increasingly does, diminish.\nUnderstanding cancer as many diseases with shared logic does not weaken hope. It grounds it.\nAnd in science, grounded hope is the kind that tends to work.",

It sounds naïve, unprofessional, even embarrassing, as if ambition itself were a flaw.

This creates a quiet cognitive dissonance: we are asked to imagine radically better futures, but rewarded for proposing only what feels safe. In that tension, it is easy to lose a sense of agency over one’s own scientific trajectory, as if progress depended less on ideas than on which version of boldness a reviewer happens to prefer. And yet, when I strip away the jargon and the defensive phrasing, what remains is simple. I study cancer. And what I am really doing (even if imperfectly, even if indirectly) is looking for ways to cure it. Perhaps that is a dream.

If curing cancer is not a single destination but a long, collective process, then aiming for it is not naïve. It is honest.\nSorry for the personal detour…",

    "text": "The Full Story\n\nBioinformatics Is Molecular Biology - Just Practised at Scale\nThere is a persistent misunderstanding in life sciences: that bioinformatics is something adjacent to molecular biology rather than part of it. That a bioinformatician is a “data person” supporting “real biology” done at the bench. This view is not only outdated; it fundamentally misrepresents what molecular biology has become.\nBioinformatics is not a service layer around molecular biology. It is molecular biology, practised through different instruments.\n\n\nMolecular biology has always been about information\nAt its core, molecular biology studies how biological information is encoded, transmitted, regulated, and altered at the molecular level. DNA, RNA, and proteins are not just molecules; they are informational entities. Genes are sequences. Regulation is pattern and timing. Mutations are edits. Expression is signal.\nFrom the moment the genetic code was deciphered, molecular biology became inseparable from abstraction, modelling, and interpretation. The bench never delivered meaning on its own; meaning always emerged from analysis.\nBioinformatics did not appear because biology became computational. It appeared because biology became measurable at informational scale.\n\n\nThe modern bench produces questions, not answers\nHigh-throughput sequencing, mass spectrometry, single-cell technologies, CRISPR screens, and spatial omics do not yield conclusions. They yield raw measurements - millions to billions of data points per experiment.\nNo amount of pipetting can tell you:\n\nwhich genes are differentially regulated,\nwhich pathways are perturbed,\nwhich variants are functional,\nwhich regulatory programs drive a phenotype,\nor which molecular mechanisms are causal rather than correlative.\n\nThose questions are answered through statistical reasoning, modelling, and computational interpretation. That is molecular biology happening after the measurement, not outside it.\n\n\nBioinformatics asks molecular biology questions\nWhat distinguishes a field is not the tools it uses, but the questions it asks.\nBioinformaticians routinely ask:\n\nHow does a mutation alter protein structure or function?\nHow do transcriptional programs change across development or disease?\nWhich molecular pathways explain a phenotype?\nHow do regulatory networks respond to perturbation?\nHow do molecular interactions scale across cell types and conditions?\n\nThese are not computational questions. They are molecular biology questions addressed with computational methods.\nA bioinformatician does not stop being a molecular biologist because the microscope is replaced by an algorithm. The object of study remains the same.\n\n\nThe algorithm is the new experimental apparatus\nIn classical molecular biology, insight came from carefully designed experiments at the bench. In modern molecular biology, insight comes from carefully designed analyses.\nAn RNA-seq differential expression model is not a technical afterthought; it is an experiment. A variant-calling pipeline is not “data cleaning”; it is molecular inference. A network model is not visualisation; it is a hypothesis about biological organisation.\nJust as poor experimental design leads to wrong conclusions at the bench, poor modelling leads to wrong biology in silico. Both require biological understanding to get right.\n\n\nSeparation of “wet” and “dry” is logistical, not intellectual\nThe idea that molecular biology happens in the lab and bioinformatics happens “afterwards” is a convenience of workflow, not a reflection of scientific reality.\nThe split exists because:\n\ninstruments are expensive and centralised,\nskills take time to acquire,\nand modern projects are collaborative.\n\nBut intellectual ownership does not stop at the centrifuge. Interpretation is not optional; it is the science.\nA molecular biologist who cannot interpret high-throughput data is incomplete. A bioinformatician who cannot reason biologically is ineffective. The boundary is artificial.\n\n\nMany foundational discoveries are computational\nSome of the most influential molecular biology discoveries of the last decades were driven primarily by bioinformatics:\n\ngene regulatory networks,\nnon-coding RNA function,\nalternative splicing landscapes,\ntumour mutational signatures,\nmolecular subtypes of disease,\nevolutionary constraints on genes and pathways.\n\nThese were not discovered by a single experiment, but by integrating many experiments into coherent molecular explanations.\n\n\nTraining does not define identity: practice does\nMany bioinformaticians were trained in molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, or medicine. Others came from physics, mathematics, or computer science and became molecular biologists through practice.\nWhat matters is not where someone started, but what biological problems they solve, how they reason about mechanisms, and whether their conclusions advance understanding of molecular systems.\nIf a person spends their professional life explaining how molecules behave in cells, they are a molecular biologist.\n\n\nThe future of molecular biology is inseparable from bioinformatics\nAs datasets grow in size, resolution, and complexity, molecular biology without computation becomes increasingly narrow. The future is not “wet versus dry”. It is integrated, iterative, and model-driven.\nIn that future, bioinformatics is not an accessory skill. It is one of the core ways molecular biology is done.\n\n\nA clearer definition\nA useful way to put it is this:\n\nMolecular biology studies biological systems at the molecular level. Bioinformatics is one of the primary ways molecular biology is practised today.\n\nRecognising this is not about status or labels. It is about accurately describing how biological knowledge is produced in the 21st century.",
