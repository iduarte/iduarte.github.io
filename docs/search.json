Here are some of my outreach projects.\n\n\nOutreach projects & Volunteering\n\nPattern Institute | Non-profit organization | Board member  [2023-present]\n\nThe Pattern Institute is a non-profit association, whose mission is science promotion and outreach.\n\n\n\nUAlg Science Community | Informal group of Researchers at UAlg  [2022-present]\n\nThe UAlg Science Community is an informal group of researchers from all UAlg research centers that get together occasionally to discuss science, mobilize scientific activities, and foster a collaborative environment between the different research areas.\n\n\n\n\n\nByte Club | Science outreach for graduate students | Founding member [2018-2021]\n\nThe Byte Club is a relaxed scientific club created by myself and Ramiro Magno in 2018, to discuss science with graduate students and other researchers, over coffee and cake. The meetings are free and open to all the academic community.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic the meetings took place on the first Thursday of each month, at Universidade do Algarve (Building 8, 3rd floor). The members take turns in choosing the topic of discussion for the next meeting. During the COVID-19 confinement in 2020, the meetings have been held online.\n\n\n\n\n\nCollaboratorium | Non-profit organization | Founding member & Volunteer  [2013-2014]\n\nCollaboratorium was a volunteering project that I started in Portugal (Vermoim, Vila Nova de Famalicão). It aimed at fostering community cohesion and collaboration around shared interests, specifically targeting young children to combat the persistently high school dropout rates in the region, particularly among girls. This initiative aided them in their studies, while also implementing engaging activities designed to increase their interest in science and technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nScientific outreach for the general public\n\nI love science & I love to write. This section showcases some of the results when these two passions collide.\n\n\nAlice in Researchland: How Large Language Models are unlocking the ultimate cancer research assistant | FEBS Honorary mention | Have you heard about Large Language Models? Or perhaps, ChatGPT? Here is what I have to say about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween 2007 and 2008, I wrote a science column for the portuguese newspaper Diário do Minho. These are the 3 most shared texts (in Portuguese only).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Association for Cancer Research Ambassador [2021-present]\n\nI am a proud cancer researcher, ambassador member of the European Association for Cancer Research (EACR).\n\n\n\n\nInteresting links\nThere are several websites that either say something about my work or about my cultural roots and personal journey.\n\nPattern Institute - Associação Pattern Institute | Non-profit organization for scientific promotion and outreach\nRISE Health - Health Research and Innovation R&D Unit\nUniversidade do Algarve - Algarve University, Faro, Portugal\nMy PhD Program - PDBC, Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência, Oeiras, Portugal\nRadboud UMC - NCMLS, Radboud Universiteit, Nijmegen, The Netherlands\nIPO - Portuguese Institute of Oncology (portuguese only)\nDaniel Baugh Institute for Functional Genomics and Computational Biology - Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, USA\nICBAS - Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal\nUniversidade do Minho - Braga, Portugal\nFCT - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, Portugal\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

It addresses the need to organize thesis project data in a centralized repository, perform regular backups, create continuous progress reports, and keep detailed records of data analyses.\nObjectives and Goals\n\nEnsure scientific data organization and accessibility by storing data in a central repository.\nImplement consistent backup procedures to prevent data loss.\nPromote transparency and continuity in data analysis through detailed documentation.\nFacilitate continuous project progress evaluation via regular updates and feedback.\n\nImplementation\nSMART has been implemented in four thesis projects at UAlg using tools like Git, GitHub, R, and RMarkdown. Key actions include setting up GitHub accounts, conducting workshops, creating RMarkdown templates, and maintaining continuous documentation and progress tracking (See implementation schedule below - In portuguese only).\nStakeholder Involvement\nThe practice benefits postgraduate students and their advisors by providing a structured framework for scientific projects, improving productivity, and ensuring continuous project monitoring. It has received positive feedback from all involved parties.\nResults and Impacts\nSMART has significantly improved data organization and accessibility, increased transparency in analyses, and facilitated continuous project monitoring. It has resulted in completed theses, publications in international journals, and the development of R packages and markdown notebooks.\nSustainability and Transferability\nSMART is sustainable due to its use of free tools and promotes a culture of scientific transparency and reproducibility. It is adaptable to different research contexts and disciplines, enhancing UAlg’s academic reputation and operational efficiency.\nInnovation and Continuous Improvement\nSMART introduces a systematic approach to data management and scientific reproducibility, addressing the previously scattered and vulnerable data storage practices. It has been evaluated and improved through continuous feedback, showing positive results and enthusiastic adoption.\nContribution to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\nThe practice contributes to:\n\nQuality Education (Goal 4) by enhancing technical and professional skills.\nIndustry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (Goal 9) by strengthening scientific research and technological capabilities.\n\nImplementation schedule\nPortuguese only\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
