    "text": "I am a strong believer that knowledge is power, so I always try to empower others by sharing my scientific knowledge and enthusiasm for science and technology. Here are some of my outreach projects.\n\n\nOutreach projects & Volunteering\n\nPattern Institute | Non-profit organization | Board member  [2023-present]\n\nThe Pattern Institute is a non-profit association, whose mission is science promotion and outreach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nByte Club | Science outreach for graduate students | Founding member [2018-2021]\n\nThe Byte Club is a relaxed scientific club created by myself and Ramiro Magno in 2018, to discuss science with graduate students and other researchers, over coffee and cake. The meetings are free and open to all the academic community.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic the meetings took place on the first Thursday of each month, at Universidade do Algarve (Building 8, 3rd floor). The members take turns in choosing the topic of discussion for the next meeting. During the COVID-19 confinement in 2020, the meetings have been held online.\n\n\n\n\n\nCollaboratorium | Non-profit organization | Founding member & Volunteer  [2013-2014]\n\nCollaboratorium was a volunteering project that I started in Portugal (Vermoim, Vila Nova de Famalicão). It aimed at fostering community cohesion and collaboration around shared interests, specifically targeting young children to combat the persistently high school dropout rates in the region, particularly among girls. This initiative aided them in their studies, while also implementing engaging activities designed to increase their interest in science and technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScientific outreach for the general public\n\nI love science & I love to write. This section showcases some of the results when these two passions collide.\n\n\nAlice in Researchland: How Large Language Models are unlocking the ultimate cancer research assistant | FEBS Honorary mention | Have you heard about Large Language Models? Or perhaps, ChatGPT? Here is what I have to say about it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween 2007 and 2008, I wrote a science column for the portuguese newspaper Diário do Minho. These are the 3 most shared texts (in Portuguese only).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Association for Cancer Research Ambassador [2021-present]\n\nI am a proud cancer researcher, ambassador member of the European Association for Cancer Research (EACR).\n\n\n\n\nInteresting links\nThere are several websites that either say something about my work or about my cultural roots and personal journey.\n\nPattern Institute - Associação Pattern Institute | Non-profit organization for scientific promotion and outreach\nCINTESIS - Center for Health Technology and Services Research (Research & Development Unit)\nUniversidade do Algarve - Algarve University, Faro, Portugal\nMy PhD Program - PDBC, Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência, Oeiras, Portugal\nCMBI - NCMLS, Radboud Universiteit, Nijmegen, The Netherlands\nIPO - Portuguese Institute of Oncology (portuguese only)\nDaniel Baugh Institute for Functional Genomics and Computational Biology - Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, USA\nICBAS - Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal\nUniversidade do Minho - Braga, Portugal\nFCT - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, Portugal"

    "text": "I am a full time scientist, and curiosity is my main driver. I am passionate about Open Science and I am always keen on establishing new collaborations.\nAcademic Resume | I have a PhD in Medical Sciences from the Radboud Universiteit (Nijmengen, The Netherlands); a Masters degree in Oncology by ICBAS - Universidade do Porto (Portugal); and a Bachelor degree in Applied Biology by Universidade do Minho Braga (Portugal). I have published over 27 articles in international journals, developed several RData packages as well as other software tools for the biomedical research community.\nWork | I use Computational Biology/Bioinformatics as a way of answering biologically relevant questions. I have used OMICs datasets to study the genetic regulation of cancer, early vertebrate embryo development, stem cell differentiation, and mitochondrial evolution.\nInterests | My research interests are focused on understanding how gene expression profiles translate into robust genetic modules that explain the phenotypic plasticity observed in healthy and diseased cells, particularly in cancer. Such knowledge holds the promise to better explain the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer biology.\n\n\nCACAU Project | Cancer causality for precision oncology\n\n\n\n\nDEvoCancer Project | Differential Allelic Expression in Breast Cancer mutations\n\n\n\n\nClockOME Project | microRNA regulation of the vertebrate embryo molecular clock\n\n\n\n\nSPLICE Project | Alternative splicing in cardiomyogenesis\n\n\n\n\nMy PhD Project | The alternative evolutionary fates of mitochondrial proteins"

I love the sun!\nI regularly organize get-together evenings of relaxed friendly discussions, and board game nights, over tea and cookies or homemade cake.\nI love animals (except for spiders… I hate spiders!). I like music, cinema, books, writing, sewing, digital painting, puzzles, science toys and gadgets, and everything pink. I like nonsense humor, chocolate and tea. I am sociable and always keen on tackling new challenges.\nOthers describe me as creative, curious, upbeat and reliable. I see myself as transparent."
